# New hire onboarding via pyOpenSci

The following needs to happen when a new team member joins pyOpenSci’s staff as core staff. 

1. **Community Initiatives Onboarding:** The new hire needs to meet with Community Initiatives HR and complete any training, fill out any paperwork, etc as Community Initiatives requires.  

On the pyOpenSci end of things:

2. **Create Employee Google Workspace Account:** An email should be created with their name@pyopensci.org via the Google Workspace admin console. 
    a. **Add staff to shared Google Drives:** Within our workspace the new hire should be added to
        i. pyos-shared
        ii. pyos-shared-social-media
    b. Add to email groups as needed: 
        i. [admin@pyopensci.org](mailto:admin@pyopensci.org) - used for administration tasks such as calls for hiring, etc. 
        ii. [media@pyopensci.org](mailto:media@pyopensci.org) - used for general social media work. 
        iii. [coc@pyopensci.org](mailto:coc@pyopensci.org) - listed in our organization [code of conduct](https://www.pyopensci.org/handbook/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html)

That new hire’s email then needs access to / permissions for:
Our GitHub organization - In some cases the new hire may already have a GitHub account. So on the first day, ask what account they prefer to use for pyOpenSci work. You can filter notifications by organization repo and email so it could be that some wish to use their personal profile so activity profiles are concentrated. The email can be modified easily on an account. .
Add to Asana - added to the pyOpenSci Operations team on Asana: we have a paid plan for Asana and it’s linked to GitHub issues. This is a great way to keep track of tasks (see more below on using Asana and tracking tasks).
Invite to Slack: Slack is our primary mode of communication day to day. See below for guidelines on how we use slack. 
Social media and content platform access as needed
Login credentials for X (Twitter), Mastodon, and BlueSky
Added to YouTube channel at appropriate level
Added to pyOpenSci LinkedIn account
Announcing the new hire to the Community!
Announce in Slack: staff will share an introduction to the new hire in #pyos-updates, and invite the new hire to introduce themselves and share a bit about themselves.
Add to website: update the text under “Our pyOpenSci” community and add new hire photo and relevant links (GitHub, LinkedIn, website, etc.).
Introductory blog post: new hire writes a brief (500–1,000 words) blog post introducing themselves to the community. The post can include topics such as: their work background, hobbies, why they joined pyOS, and what they’ll be doing with pyOS.
Social media : Community Manager will draft announcements for each social channel for review by ED and new hire, then post according to social schedules.
Shared Calendars & time tracking
Calendly: we have a subscription to Calendly that can be used to schedule meetings. If the new hire wishes to use calendly, then we can purchase another license. 
Google Calendar: We use google calendar given it’s a part of the Google workspace to keep track of schedules. 
All employees should share Google calendars with the team - it’s helpful for us all to know where and when we are working. 
If you have appointments that are confidential such as medical appointments please make them private so the team knows you are unavailable at that time. Work related appointments should be public to the pyOpenSci team unless they are confidential in nature. 
Don't interrupt: Don’t interrupt is setup in Slack. Use this tool to link your calendar to slack so it’s easy to tell when you are online and available vs offline / on vacation, etc. This is invaluable particularly when working asynchronously. 
Staff check-ins
When a new member joins the pyOpenSci team, they may need more up-front meeting time to adjust to the organization and our work environment. As such, when an employee starts, a standard weekly check-in time will be scheduled with their manager to discuss both current tasks and how things are going overall. 

These meetings are a good time to ask for help or guidance, talk about challenges we face as a community, and suggest ways to improve our workflows. The meeting cadence can be flexible, accommodating each employee's needs. If we find that a bi-weekly meeting might be more productive we will move to that. If weekly meetings continue to be fruitful we will stick to that schedule. 
How we work
Task management 
We use a combination of Asana and GitHub to track and communicate about work tasks. Asana is used for general task management. Our Asana account is also connected to GitHub. 

We use GitHub to create issues around bugs and features we want to add to various content in our pyOpenSci GitHub organization. GitHub is public facing to our entire community.  

Important: if a conversation comes up about something in slack where it’s clear we need better / additional documentation, turn that conversation into an issue (sometimes the community member involved might volunteer to do this as well). That way we can keep track of things that need to be updated, fixed etc as the output of a slack conversation. If we determine that the issue is high priority or time sensitive then we may also turn it into a linked asana task and assign it to someone on the core team.

Asana is an internal tool we use as pyOpenSci staff. Within Asana, the general workflow is that we can assign each other tasks that need to be accomplished along with task deadlines. In our checkin’s we can review tasks, update deadlines as needed and discuss future efforts. Asana can also be used to build road maps for projects as needed.
