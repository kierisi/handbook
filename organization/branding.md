# The pyOpenSci brand

The pyOpenSci brand is playful, curious, and integrates a calm color palette with illustrations and abstract primary shapes that are soft, round, and flowing.  

## Logos, colors, and fonts

pyOpenSci stores its logos, brand colors, and font information in [Canva](https://www.pyopensci.org/handbook/organization/canva.html). We also store logos in a [publicly-shared Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m4cG3JLonP0mQ8y3pBaULMulpja-As0l?usp=drive_link).  

### pyOpenSci logos

pyOpenSci uses three variations on a floral logo: 
* pyOpenSci written horizontally, with a flower "blooming" over the "O" in pyOpenSci
* a four- or five-petaled flower with pyOpenSci abbreviated as pyOS
* a five-petaled flower icon

From left to right, the logos include a dark purple logo with three petals above the word pyOpenSci. The 'O' in pyOpenSci is the center of the flower. The second image from the left is a four-petaled flower, with the text py and then an S in the shape of a snake inside an O. The text comes in from the left. The flower petals surround the O. The next image is identical to the second from the left, but is in a lighter shade of purple. The final image is the pyOpenSci flower, which has five petals and an open center. This logo is in light purple.

### pyOpenSci fonts 

pyOpenSci uses [Itim](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Itim) and [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) as its fonts. Itim is most commonly used as a header, while Poppins is used for the body of a text. Poppins is available in multiple weights, and at this time pyOpenSci uses the most appropriate weight for accessibility and readability, which varies by use case. Both of these fonts are available via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).  

## Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility

pyOpenSci builds diverse community that supports free and open Python tools for processing scientific data. pyOpenSci accomplishes this through a combination of community building, mentorship, peer review of software and education and outreach. We are building the pyOpenSci community in a way that promotes fairness and justice for all, with a particular focus on supporting those from traditionally marginalized / underrepresented groups. We want every member of our community to thrive; we want to make a positive impact on our community membersâ€™ work and on the work of others. You can learn more about how this is put into action by reading through our [Code of Conduct](https://www.pyopensci.org/handbook/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html).  

### DEIA in [Peer Review](https://www.pyopensci.org/about-peer-review/index.html)

pyOpenSci recruits and supports editors and reviewers from different backgrounds and gender-identities in each review that we perform.

To break this down into concrete actions:
* We actively recruit individuals from underrepresented backgrounds
* We support people through individualized mentorship
* When possible, we elevate people into leadership roles
