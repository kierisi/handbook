# The pyOpenSci brand

## Logos, colors, and fonts

pyOpenSci stores its logos, brand colors, and font information in [Canva](https://www.pyopensci.org/handbook/organization/canva.html). We also store logos in a [publicly-shared Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m4cG3JLonP0mQ8y3pBaULMulpja-As0l?usp=drive_link).  

### pyOpenSci logos

pyOpenSci uses three variations on a floral logo: 
* pyOpenSci written horizontally, with a flower "blooming" over the "O" in pyOpenSci
* a four- or five-petaled flower with pyOpenSci abbreviated as pyOS
* a five-petaled flower icon

From left to right, the logos include a dark purple logo with three petals above the word pyOpenSci. The 'O' in pyOpenSci is the center of the flower. The second image from the left is a four-petaled flower, with the text py and then an S in the shape of a snake inside an O. The text comes in from the left. The flower petals surround the O. The next image is identical to the second from the left, but is in a lighter shade of purple. The final image is the pyOpenSci flower, which has five petals and an open center. This logo is in light purple.

### pyOpenSci fonts 

pyOpenSci uses [Itim](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Itim) and [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) as its fonts. Itim is most commonly used as a header, while Poppins is used for the body of a text. Poppins is available in multiple weights, and at this time pyOpenSci uses the most appropriate weight for accessibility and readability, which varies by use case. Both of these fonts are available via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
