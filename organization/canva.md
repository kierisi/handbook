# pyOpenSci uses Canva as a shared graphic platform
pyOpenSci has a nonprofit Pro license for [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), and uses the platform for:
* Asset creation
* Diagramming
* Creative strategy work

Canva is an online graphic design platform that that provides tools which makes it easy to create social media graphics, presentations, videos, and more. One of the (many!) benefits of using Canva as a nonprofit is their copyright ownership of designs, as outlined in [Canva's Content License Agreement](https://www.canva.com/policies/content-license-agreement/). With the Pro license, pyOpenSci is able to use a wide range of pre-created images, illustrations, effects, and templates.

The majority of assets used in the pyOpenSci ecosystem are created and stored in Canva, including our brand template. This includes logos, such as the pyOpenSci flower, as well as the pyOpenSci color palette and typeface guides.

:alt: A screenshot of the GitHub CI notifications for a sample pyOpenSci repository. There are four rows of information. The first row reads "1 workflow awaiting approval. This workflow requires approval from a maintainer. Learn more about approving workflows. 1 failing and 1 successful checks. To the far right of the row is linked text reading Hide all checks. The text Learn more about approving workflows is linked. The second row has a red x on the left, followed by the letter P in a gold square, and the text pre-commit.ci - pr -- checks completed with failures. To the far right is linked text reading Details. On the third row there is a green check mark followed by the Circle CI logo and the text ci/circleci: build_book -- Your tests passed on CircleCI! And to the far right there is linked text reading Details. The fourth and final row has a small white checkmark inside a large green circle with text reading This branch has no conflicts with the base branch. Only those with write access to this repository can merge pull requests. The text write access is linked.
When a CI check fails, you'll see a red 'X' next to the CI check that hasn't passed

pyOpenSci is currently collaborating with a graphic designer to finalize branding assets, but in the interim, the current brand template in Canva should be used for both color palettes and font choices. Because branding has not yet been finalized, any new designs should first be approved by the Executive Director and Founder, Leah Wasser, before going live. This includes both internal and external communications.

In addition, all assets should be shared with the pyOpenSci team within Canva. This is accomplished by clicking “Share” in the top right of the screen, then selecting the pyopensci-canva-team and “Can edit” from beneath the collaboration link header.

Once assets are approved and shared, they should also be stored in the appropriate Project folder (and subfolders, where appropriate) on Canva. Where needed, please create additional folders in order to keep assets organized and easy to find. When there are questions about folder organization and naming, please reach out to the pyOpenSci Executive Director and Founder, Leah Wasser, for clarification.
