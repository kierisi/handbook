# pyOpenSci uses Canva as a shared graphic platform

pyOpenSci has a nonprofit Pro license for [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), and uses the platform for:
* Asset creation
* Diagramming
* Creative strategy work

Canva is an online graphic design platform that that provides tools which makes it easy to create social media graphics, presentations, videos, and more. One of the (many!) benefits of using Canva as a nonprofit is their copyright ownership of designs, as outlined in [Canva's Content License Agreement](https://www.canva.com/policies/content-license-agreement/). With the Pro license, pyOpenSci is able to use a wide range of pre-created images, illustrations, effects, and templates.

## pyOpenSci assets and brand content

The majority of assets used in the pyOpenSci ecosystem are created and stored in Canva, including our brand template. This includes logos, such as the pyOpenSci flower, as well as the pyOpenSci color palette and typeface guides.

:alt: A series of four purple flower logos on grey backgrounds, arranged in a single row. At the top of the collection is the text 'Logos', and underneath it is the text 'Assets(4).' The logos, from left to right, include a dark purple logo with three petals above the word pyOpenSci. The 'O' in pyOpenSci is the center of the flower. The second image from the left is a four-petaled flower, with the text py and then an S in the shape of a snake inside an O. The text comes in from the left, and the flower petals surround the O. The next image is identical to the second from the left, but is in a lighter shade of purple. The final image is the pyOpenSci flower, which has five petals and an open center. This logo is in light purple.

The circles contain the following colors, with the corresponding hex code written beneath them: dark purple #33205C, medium purple #735FAB, light purple #BAB3D4, cream #F6F0DC, pink #BB92B0, and green #81C0AA.

## Project organization within Canva

When creating content within Canva, it's important to note that the content will be created under your own pyOpenSci account. In order to ensure transparency and openness, one of the first things you need to do upon starting a new project in Canva is to share it with the pyopensci-canva-team. This can be accomplished by clicking the 'Share' button in the top right, and then selecting pyopensci-canva-team from the Collaboration Link dropdown.

```{figure} /images/canva-images/canva-share.png
:alt: This image is comprised primarily of text, which reads left-to-right, top-to-bottom. In the top right there are three buttons: a small graph for analytics, a button to 'Publish as Brand Template', and a 'Share' button. When the Share button is clicked, the resulting menu has text that reads 'Share this design.' Beneath that is 'People with access' and a hyper-linked Edit button. Beneath that is a text box, where individuals can be added. Beneath that are a series of circles, which are icons for all of the individuals who currently have access to a given Canva project. Then there is text that reads 'Collaboration link,' below which is a dropdown menu on the left, and permissions on the right. The dropdown options are: Only people added can access (Only people with access to the design can use this link.), pyopensci-canva-team (Anyone from pyopensci-canva-team can access the design using this link), Anyone with the link (Anyone can access the design using this link. No sign in required.) In this screenshot, the pyopensci-canva-team is selected, and the permissions are set to 'Can edit.'

Once the Canva project has been shared with the broader pyOpenSci team, it can be accessed from the Projects menu on the Canva home page. The project can then be added to the appropriate folder on the home page. As of this writing, pyOpenSci uses the following folders:

* pyopensci-website
* proposal-graphics
* pyOS branding
* meeting-social-graphics
* talk-graphics
* peer-review-packaging
* pyos-pillars-website
* pyos-logo-mission-programs-graphics
* pyos-social
* memes
* pyOS blog
* pyOS events
* event-graphics
* open-science
* content-strategy

Where needed, please create additional folders in order to keep assets organized and easy to find. When there are questions about folder organization and naming, please reach out to the pyOpenSci Executive Director and Founder, Leah Wasser, for clarification.

### A note on Canva Project organization

Canva allows you to create over 1,000 pages in a single project. This, however, can be difficult to navigate. Instead, try to keep the number of pages between 10--15, and using a strong naming schema to make it clear when two (or more) projects are related to one another.

It's also good practice to use good naming principles for each of the pages within a Canva project, to prevent a long list of `Untitled` files.

## Canva permissions

At this point in time, the only individuals with access to the pyOpenSci Canva account are staff members, an advisor, and a contract graphic designer. There are no current plans to expand access beyond these individuals, however exceptions may be made at the sole discretion of pyOpenSci's Executive Director and Founder, Leah Wasser. Individuals with the Administrator (pyOpenSci staff) or Owner (pyOpenSci Executive Director) privilege have the ability to add people to the Canva team.

To add someone to Canva, click on the "Invite members" text in the bottom left of the homepage, enter the email address of the individual, and choose the correct level of access (Administrator, Brand Designer, or Member). If you are unsure, select "Member" and clarify with the Executive Director which permissions should be granted to a given individual. The permissions for each level are:

* Administrator: Can manage the entire team, its content, and Brand
* Brand Designer: Can manage Brand Kits and Brand Templates
* Member: Can only access team designs and folders

When someone leaves pyOpenSci, they should be removed from the pyOpenSci Canva account. This is done by clicking on the Settings wheel from within Canva, and navigating to the People section of the pyopensci-canva-team menu on the left. From there, click the arrow next to an individual's Team role and select "Remove from team."

This action can only be performed by the account Owner and Administrators.
